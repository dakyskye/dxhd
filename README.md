This is a rewrite of dxhd.

[go to master branch](https://github.com/dakyskye/dxhd)

## Notice

Dear repository visitor, I'm sorry I wrote a horrible codebase years ago
which I've tried to rewrite a couple of times now but never finished
because of losing interest sometimes, because of work sometimes, because
of my "time for a new side-project" mood sometimes.

However, I want to tell you the rewrite will definitely take place,
because I want to apply things I have learnt to dxhd. I want to write a
proper parser this time, I want to structure codebase properly this time,
I want to show my today's Go knowledge & practice in dxhd codebase because
current master branch isn't it. I usually put dxhd in my CV but always
hate to do it because current master codebase does not show my present Go
skills but rather my past mistakes that taught me to do researches, think
before taking an action etc.

I cannot tell when I will start actively working on the rewrite because at
the time, I have busy schedule and I am still at working on my schedule.
I want to dedicate time for FOSS contributions so my schedule will definitely
have hours dedicated for that.

The rewrite is taking place in
[another-rewrite](https://github.com/dakyskye/dxhd/tree/another-rewrite) branch.

Thanks for attention üôè
